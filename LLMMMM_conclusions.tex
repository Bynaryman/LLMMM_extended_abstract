\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Overall, by the mean of a custom open source framework, we are able to generate MMM units for several arithmetic specifciations and ttechnology nodes.
We show the performance metrics of 28 distinct chips that have been generated within an hour, which is possible thanks to open source EDA tools.

As a future perpectives, we need to correlate the performance metrics measured with accuracy metrics in order to find the best entry in the vast accuracy/energy efficiency design space exploration.
In light of these promising results, we ecnourage researchers to interact with our tool.
