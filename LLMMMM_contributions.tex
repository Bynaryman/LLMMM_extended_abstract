\subsection{MMM kernels generation}
\label{sec:contributions}
It is clear that the importance budgets implied in training LLMs is no afordable in a age where known computer science laws are being rstes such moore law, dennard, dark silicon era.

Which explains the heavy need for specialization, specialized cirtuits to explore the emerging float format in the cotext of mmm units. which is possible with the fast evolution of open source EDA tools~\cite{OpenROAD,us_osda}.

Figure~\ref{weight_distribution} puts together the distribution of the weights dynamic range alongside with the computer format we evaluate.
The evaluations comprise the computer formats of the figure with different Systolic Array sizes with five PDKs (GF180, SKy130hd, Sky130hs, nangate45, ASAP7) which allow to verify scalability of designs without the use of manual scaling.

2 variations of accum per arith, very important as computing is less expensive than communictaion, we can add some complexity in the chip to leverage data movemenrt by taking int oaccount he sequential nature of mmm and dot products maximizing entropy.
